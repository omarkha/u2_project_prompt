## **Idea**

This app will add players to clubs within a soccer league.

each player will have the following attributes:

### _The Players: name_

### _The Players: age_

### _The Players: county_

### _The Players: city_

### _The Players: position_

### _The Players: height_

### _The Players: weight_

### _The Players: strongfoot_

### _The Players: club_

### _The Players: email_

### _The Players: phone_

Then there's the ' Add ' Button that is pressed once data has been typed for the player. Then the player is submitted.

Also, there will be a ' Search Tools ' button that pulls up search tools.

I plan to make my APP able to search the database by any attribute within the player's object. That way the user can, for example, search for all the players who are '25' years old. Or all the people who have the name "Ryan Garcia"...etc.

After the search has been submitted, the results will be displayed.

## _Results_

The returned results will be displayed in a div components with an h1 of the full name of the contact. Below it there will be the club name and below it will be the player's county, city, age

Yet below that, there wil be the position, height and weight of the player.

And, below that, finally, there will be the preferred foot, the email and phone number.

## _Modifying Results_

The user will be able to select the player they wish to delete or modify. and either click on a button with the text of ' delete ' or ' edit '

when a contact is selected and the ' delete ' button is clicked, the contact is ' deleted '

if a player is selected and the ' modify ' button is clicked, the input field with the player's info typed will pop up and the user can then change the info and click ' modify ' to change the info.
